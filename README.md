# PredicitiveAlgo_SP500
Data Analysis 1 Project for CodeLouisville
Using python data analysis and Machine Learning to establish a predictive algorithm. 

# Purpose:
This project will attempt to create a predictive algorithm for a stock price based on historical data and an API that will pull the current stock price. 
It will use statistical analysis to establish seasonal, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly trends. 

# Libraries: 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- tbd... 

# Features (to be used)
- Use an API call to retrieve the current stock price. 
- Use custom functions to clean data. 
- Use pandas for basic calculations
- Display charts for historical trends
- Save historical data in .csv and read file to establish trends. 
- (if time allows) Put all this into an html page for UI and display. 
- I will reecord accuracy of tests from completed project. 
- I will utilized in-line code comments to explain each section of code. 

# Data Sources
- Current and Historical Market data will be pulled via API from https://app.alpaca.markets.
